# Using Edge Impulse Uploader

The RASynBoard can be used to collect IMU data to upload to Edge Impulse for training or testing.

## Prerequisites

### Load the RASynBoard OOB Application onto your device
You should have the latest RASynBoard OOB release loaded onto your RASynBoard including the microSD card files associated with the release.

- [Using RASynBoard Releases](./UsingRASynbBoardReleases.md)
    - All the details you need to load the latest OOB tested release onto your board
- [RASynBoard Getting Started Guide](./RASyBoardGettingStarted.md)
    - All the details to clone the OOB repo, build the application and load it onto your RASynBoard

### Install NodeJS with npm
In order to use the data forwarder, you must have NodeJS with npm installed. Please refer to the NodeJS website for installation: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

Once you have installed NodeJS and npm, install the Edge Impulse CLI tools with the following command:

MacOS/Linux:

```bash
sudo npm install -g edge-impulse-cli
```

Windows:

```Powershell
npm install -g edge-impulse-cli
```

## Setting Up RASynBoard
- Verify you have copied all the microSD card files onto your RASynBoard microSD card's root directory
    - If using the latest release use files in the microSD-Files-v<current version>.zip file
    - If building the project copy all the files in the ndp120/synpkg_files directory onto your microSD card's root directory

Modify the config.ini to contain the following:

**Note** We're . . . 
- Loading the "Circle Motion" model
- Setting the recording period to 30 seconds
- Sending the IMU data output to a file

Remove the microSD card and insert into the RAsynBoard.

Power on the RASynBoard.

## Capturing Data

### Run CSV Wizard

Create a free account with Edge Impulse and create a new project if one isn't already created: https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/profile/projects

Press the user button to start printing IMU data to the serial port:

![](assets/images/UserButton.jpg "")

Navigate back to the projects page and select your project. In the project, select the `Data Acqusition page. Startup the CSV Wizard by clicking CSV Wizard:
![Edge Impulse Acquisition Screen](assets/images/acq_upload_button.png "Edge Impulse Acquisition Screen")

Remove the microSD card from the RASynBoard and mount it on your computer. Click select file and select the IMU csv file:
![Select File](assets/images/acq_select_file.png "Select File")

You should be presented with a preview of the uploaded data.

Remove the microSD card from the RASynBoard and mount it on your computer. Click select file and select the IMU csv file:
![Preview Data](assets/images/acq_preview.png "Preview Data")

Click the next button.

You'll be presented with a pane to specify the type of data. Ensure that the time series option is slected and the option stating each column contains a reading and fill row contains a sample:
![Step 3](assets/images/acq_upload_step_3.png "Step 3")

Click the next button.

On the pane, select no for the first option. For first column, select `Acc_x` and last column select `Gyro_z`.

For the list of sensors, enter:

```
accel,gyro
```

For data frequency, enter 200Hz
![Step 4](assets/images/acq_upload_step_4.png "Step 4")

Finally, select finish wizard.

# Setup and Run Uploader

Run the following command in a terminal window:

```bash
edge-impulse-uploader --label <LABEL_NAME> --category <training|testing> <PATH TO CSV FILE>
```

Replace `<LABEL_NAME>` with the desired label name. After `--category` specify whether the data is used for trainging or testing. Finally, specify the path of the file you're uploading. 

Example:

```bash
edge-impulse-uploader --label circle --category trainging ./ndp_imu_record_0000.csv
```

At this point, you should be prompted with your Edge Impulse credentials:

```
Edge Impulse uploader v1.20.0
? What is your user name or e-mail address (edgeimpulse.com)? evan.stoddard@avnet.com
? What is your password? [hidden]
```

If you have more than one project, the following menu will be presented:

```
Upload configuration:
    Label:       circle
    Category:    training

? To which project do you want to upload the data? 
  Evan Stoddard / RASynBoard-Forwarder 
‚ùØ Evan Stoddard / RASynBoard-Uploader 
```

Select the desired project. If there's only one project on your account, it will automatically be selected.

At this point the file should be uploaded:

```
[1/1] Uploading /ndp_imu_record_0000.csv OK (1626 ms)

Done. Files uploaded successful: 1. Files that failed to upload: 0.
```

The data should appear on the edge impulse data aqcuisition page:
